# 🧪 Test Repository: Archiving Experiment 📦

## 📘 Overview

Welcome to this **test repository**!  
This repository was created **just for fun and experimentation purposes**.  
Its main goal? 👉 **To observe what happens when a repository is archived**.

---

## 🔍 Purpose

The key objectives of this test are:

- ✅ Understand how archived repositories behave
- 📁 Explore GitHub's interface changes after archiving
- ❓ See what actions are restricted when a repo is archived
- 🧰 Test if issues, PRs, and other features remain accessible

---

## ⚠️ Note

This repository **does not contain any real code** or production content.  
It's simply a sandbox to try out GitHub's **archive** feature.

---

## 🧊 What Does "Archived" Mean?

When a repository is **archived**, it becomes:

- 🛑 Read-only (no more pushes, issues, or PRs)
- 📚 Preserved for reference
- 🧼 A clean way to freeze development

---

## 🧪 Status

> Currently: **[ARCHIVED]**  
(Update this line once you've archived it!)

## 🙌 Thanks

Thanks for stopping by!  
If you were curious like me, feel free to fork this and try archiving it yourself 😄
